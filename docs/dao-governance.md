# 🗳 MARTHOS DAO Governance Plan

This document outlines the proposed governance model for MARTHOS as it evolves into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

---

## 🎯 Purpose
To enable fair, transparent, and contribution-based decision-making for the future of MARTHOS through a token/NFT-based DAO structure.

---

## 🧱 Governance Structure

### Roles & Voting Rights
| Role | NFT Required | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| 👤 Contributor | 🌱 Supporter NFT | PRs, Docs, Issues, Translations |
| 🔧 Developer | 🔧 Developer NFT | Merged PRs, API work, frontend/backend commits |
| 🛠 Maintainer | 🛡 Maintainer NFT | Code review, security, infra roles |
| 🧠 Architect | 🧠 Architect NFT | Core architecture, protocol logic |
| 🏛 DAO Operator | Multi-NFT or community election | Strategic direction, fund management |

---

## 📊 Voting Mechanism

### Phase 1 – Snapshot-based Voting (Testnet Phase)
- Voting via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) using Contributor NFTs
- Off-chain signature-based voting for proposals

### Phase 2 – On-Chain Voting (Mainnet DAO Phase)
- Proposal submission smart contract
- Voting power = NFT + Contribution Score
- Fully auditable and trustless on-chain decision-making

---

## ⚖️ Proposal Types

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| 🧩 Technical | Add new AI validation algorithm |
| 💸 Treasury | Allocate funds to marketing or bug bounty |
| 📈 Growth | DAO partner onboarding, hackathons |
| 📣 Governance | Upgrade voting rules, roles, or structure |

---

## 🧠 Contribution Score (Optional Weighting System)

| Action | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Code commit | +3 |
| Bug report | +2 |
| Document translation | +1 |
| Community support | +1 |

NFT holders with more contributions may gain higher voting weight.

---

## 🔐 Security & Safeguards
- Multi-sig for treasury transactions (e.g., 3-of-5 governance signers)
- DAO voting logs will be mirrored to IPFS
- All proposal results permanently logged on-chain

---

## 🚀 Roadmap to Full DAO
1. Launch MVP voting via Snapshot (Q2 2025)
2. Issue contribution NFTs to active users
3. Test on-chain proposals with limited scope
4. Finalize smart contract + mainnet migration (Q4 2025)
