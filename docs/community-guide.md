MARTHOS believes that **every contribution has value**, and that
**participation should be remembered, rewarded, and respected**.

This project is built on the principles of:

- **Transparency**: All contributions are visible and verifiable on-chain.
- **Decentralization**: We are building toward a DAO where governance is shared.
- **Recognition**: Contributions are rewarded with NFTs and public acknowledgment.
